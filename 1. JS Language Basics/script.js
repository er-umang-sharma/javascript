/**
 * Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
 * 1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
 * 2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
 * 3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!
 * 
 * TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
 * HINT: Call calcTip in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays ðŸ˜‰
 * 
 * 4. BONUS: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:
 * 4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together
 * 4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
 * 4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array
 *
